### Recent News

I don’t have live web access in this chat, so I can’t pull today’s headlines for NVIDIA.

If you paste 5–10 recent headlines/links (or specify a timeframe, e.g., “past 24 hours” or “past week”), I’ll synthesize the top 3 stories and explain:
- What happened (one-liner)
- Why it matters (impact on Data Center/Gaming/Auto, competitive/ regulatory angle)
- Key numbers and expected market reaction

Alternatively, enable browsing or share a news source snapshot (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, NVIDIA IR) and I’ll proceed.

### Stock Price Data

I don’t have live quote access in this chat, so I can’t fetch NVDA’s last 30 days directly.

If you can share the last 30 daily closes (or enable browsing), I’ll compute:
- 30-day return and annualized pace
- 5-day vs 20-day moving averages and crossover status
- Linear-regression slope of price (trend strength)
- RSI(14) for momentum and overbought/oversold context
- Max drawdown and volatility (stdev of daily returns)
- A concise “Up / Down / Sideways” trend call with a one-paragraph explanation

Quick ways to get the data
- Yahoo Finance: finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history → Time Period: Past 1 Month → Apply → Download. Share the CSV or paste Date and Close columns.
- Broker/terminal export: any OHLC data with Close is fine (about 22 trading days).

If you prefer to do it yourself, here’s the minimal checklist:
- 30-day return = (LastClose / FirstClose) - 1
- MAs: compute 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages; trend ≈ Up if Close > 20D MA and 5D > 20D; Down if opposite; Sideways if mixed and range-bound
- Regression slope: fit Close ~ DayIndex; positive and statistically meaningful implies uptrend
- RSI(14): >60 supports uptrend; <40 supports downtrend

Share the data and I’ll deliver the trend assessment immediately. TERMINATE

### Financial Metrics

I don’t have live data in this chat, but here’s a concise checklist of NVIDIA’s basic financial metrics and the key ratios investors use—plus how to compute them from the latest 10-Q/10-K and price. If you share the most recent figures (or a link/screenshot), I’ll compute the exact numbers for you.

What to report (grouped) and how to calculate

Valuation
- Market cap = Share price × Diluted shares outstanding
- Enterprise value (EV) = Market cap + Total debt – Cash & investments
- P/E (TTM and forward) = Price per share / EPS (TTM or next 12 months)
- PEG = Forward P/E / Expected EPS growth rate
- EV/EBITDA (TTM) = EV / EBITDA
- EV/Sales (TTM) and Price/Sales (TTM) = EV or Market cap / Revenue (TTM)
- Price/Book = Market cap / Shareholders’ equity
- FCF yield = Free cash flow (TTM) / Market cap; Earnings yield = 1 / P/E

Profitability
- Gross margin = Gross profit / Revenue
- Operating margin = Operating income / Revenue
- Net margin = Net income / Revenue
- EBITDA margin = EBITDA / Revenue
- FCF margin = Free cash flow / Revenue

Growth
- Revenue growth (YoY, TTM) = (RevenueTTM / RevenueTTM-1) – 1
- EPS growth (YoY, TTM) = (EPSTTM / EPSTTM-1) – 1
- 3-year CAGRs for revenue and EPS (if available)

Returns and efficiency
- ROE = Net income / Average shareholders’ equity
- ROIC = NOPAT / Average invested capital
- ROA = Net income / Average total assets
- Asset turnover = Revenue / Average total assets

Leverage and liquidity
- Net cash (or net debt) = Cash & investments – Total debt
- Debt/EBITDA = Total debt / EBITDA
- Interest coverage = EBIT / Interest expense
- Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities
- Quick ratio = (Cash + Marketable securities + Receivables) / Current liabilities

Per-share and capital return
- Diluted shares outstanding; buyback activity (TTM)
- Dividend per share, yield = DPS / Price; payout ratio = Dividends / Net income

Operating mix/other (from segment note)
- Revenue by segment: Data Center, Gaming, Pro Viz, Auto/Embedded
- Customer concentration: % from top customers (if disclosed)
- Stock-based comp as % of revenue and of FCF

What NVIDIA’s profile typically looks like (directionally, based on recent filings through late 2024)
- Valuation: Premium multiples (P/E, EV/Sales, EV/EBITDA) vs. semi peers due to AI growth leadership.
- Profitability: Top-tier margins for semis; substantial gross and operating margin expansion with Data Center mix and software.
- Growth: Triple-digit YoY revenue and EPS growth during the recent AI investment cycle.
- Returns: Very high ROIC/ROE (asset-light model, strong margins).
- Balance sheet: Net cash position and strong liquidity; minimal leverage relative to EBITDA.
- Cash flow: Robust FCF from earnings strength; capex limited given fabless model.

What I need from you to compute the exact latest ratios
- Latest share price and diluted shares outstanding
- TTM: Revenue, Gross profit, Operating income, Net income, D&A, EBITDA (or I can derive), CFO and Capex (for FCF)
- Balance sheet: Cash & marketable securities, Total debt, Shareholders’ equity, Current assets/liabilities, Total assets
- Optional: Street EPS growth estimate (for PEG), segment revenue mix

Quick sources
- NVIDIA IR: latest 10-Q/10-K and investor presentation
- SEC: NVDA filings (TTM numbers can be compiled from last 4 quarters)
- Yahoo/Google Finance: price, market cap, share count; confirm against filings

Send the figures (or a screenshot), and I’ll return a clean metrics table plus a 5-bullet interpretation of what the ratios imply right now. TERMINATE
